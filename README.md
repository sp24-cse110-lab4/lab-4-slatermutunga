# Lab4_Starter

For this section of the lab we would like you to:
1. Clone the repo
2. Create an new branch named `lab4-fix`. to fix the buggy code in the scripts folder. 
3. After you have fixed the buggy code, we would like you to create a pull request to the main branch which will cause the pipeline with automated tests to run.
4. If all is done correctly, you will get a green checkmark saying ready to merge! Please take a screenshot of this checkmark. (Make sure your github username is somewhere in the screenshot)

### Details

The changes will be fairly simple, and shouldn't take much time. The main reason for this section is to get familiar with what creating a pull request looks like. More specific, the process of what passing automated testing looks like when trying to create/merge a pull request. For instance, first try adding a comment as your change and then create a pull request. What happens? We want you to be familiar with this process since it is a part of what we call a pipeline. Pipelines are in place to try to prevent poorly written code going live (main branch). Having a pipeline is a crucial part of software engineering.

### Bonus Question(No credit)

How could have this buggy code gotten into the repo, if the pipeline was already in place?
